All these bhajans are prepared by most dedicated artists (<strong>Singers, Musicians, Composers, Performers, A Great Devotee of GEOKC and other Great Devotees of GEOKC<\/strong>) of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/geokc-mn.org\/geokc-devotional-music\">GEOKC Devotional Music<\/a>&nbsp;and sung with traditional musical instruments used in bhajans. One attractive feature of this devotional program is the traditional bhajans also composed, sung, and performed by A Great Devotee of GEOKC by her own bhakti bhava (expression of love) for Lord Krishna to establish or form a bhakti tradition (the relationship between God and His devotees) and to give guidance to other Great Devotees of GEOKC to keep this tradition alive forever. Sometimes, A Great Devotee of GEOKC compose, sings, and performs with other Great Devotees of GEOKC to express bhakti especially for Lord Krishna as His devotional singers. This is a great step of devotees to reach to bhakti and also related to the history and ancient origin of devotional bhajans as goal of GEOKC Traditional Bhajans to form a singing style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before composing and singing any bhajan, the spiritual master of the program of GEOKC Devotional Music gives important instructions to all dedicated artists (Singers, Musicians, Composers, Performers, A Great Devotee of GEOKC and other Great Devotees of GEOKC) including: styles, composing, singing, using traditional musical instruments, performing, and the occasions in which they are singing bhajans, to express their love or devotion for Lord Krishna. The spiritual master also gives instructions to all participants, joining this program to follow all rules and regulations accordingly to complete the process of singing. The last step of devotees of GEOKC Traditional Music is to sing bhajans with other singers of&nbsp;<strong>Bhajan Mandali<\/strong>&nbsp;(Mandali means group) to express their love or devotion to Lord Krishna.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>GEOKC Traditional Bhajans are only dedicated to Lord Krishna and are written in many different styles to give a specific meaning of singing GEOKC Traditional Bhajans to complete the process of singing bhajans. Generally these devotional bhajans are sung in a group named Bhajan Mandali by which the process of singing of devotional bhajans is recognized as GEOKC Traditional Bhajans. This Bhajan Mandali always includes a designated lead singer to sing with other dedicated artists. All bhajans are beautifully written and describes the purpose of their singing only for Lord Krishna of His&nbsp;<strong>Unforgettable Love<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Great Devotee of GEOKC mostly composes, sings, and performs as a designated lead singer in a group named Bhajan Mandali by which the process of singing of devotional bhajans is recognized as GEOKC Traditional Bhajans and belong to the group named&nbsp;Bhajans of A Great Devotee. All bhajans are beautifully written and describe the purpose of her singing only for Lord Krishna of His Unforgettable Love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Great Devotees of GEOKC also compose, sing, and perform in the same style as A Great Devotee of GEOKC to follow the bhakti tradition, only one by one or as a designated lead singer in a group named Bhajan Mandali (Mandali means group) by which the process of singing of devotional bhajans is recognized as GEOKC Traditional Bhajans and belong to the group name&nbsp;Bhajans of Great Devotees. Bhajans sung by other Great Devotees of GEOKC are also beautifully written and describes the purpose of his or her singing only for Lord Krishna of His Unforgettable Love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole process of singing bhajans makes a new impression upon all audiences and discover something new (as a symbol or related with&nbsp;GEOKC LOGO Symbol) which popularize the bhajan style or called GEOKC Traditional Bhajans. This tradition gives the correct and significant meaning of Lilas of Lord Krishna (Lilas means divine play) in the sense of bhakti to our devotees and all other audiences. The Bhajan Mandali works in a rotating shift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following list includes many types of groups of bhajans with their specific names especially created for Lord Krishna and dedicated to him. All these bhajans are created by dedicated artists, A Great Devotee of GEOKC, and Great Devotees of GEOKC of the Bhajan Mandali. We can found all these groups of devotional bhajans into the&nbsp;Divine Love Album of GEOKC Traditional Bhajans&nbsp;in a systematic way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"
